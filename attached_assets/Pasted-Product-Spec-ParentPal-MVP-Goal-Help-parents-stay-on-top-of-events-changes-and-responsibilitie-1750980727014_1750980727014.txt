Product Spec: ParentPal (MVP)

Goal:Help parents stay on top of events, changes, and responsibilities related to their children by extracting relevant info from school emails and aligning it with their custody schedule.

MVP Features

1. Email IngestionEach user receives a custom forwarding email address (e.g., ed@parentpal.app). Parents forward school emails to this address. The app polls for new messages frequently and ingests their content.

2. Event Extraction (NLP Lite)The app parses emails to identify:

Event name and description

Date and time

Required preparation (e.g., costumes, field trip forms, money)

Cancellations or changes

A lightweight NLP model or rule-based parser will structure this information.

3. Parenting Schedule InputUsers upload their parenting schedule via a Word table or paste it into a form. The app maps this schedule to an internal calendar, identifying which parent is responsible on each day.

4. Smart NotificationsNotifications are generated based on event timing and which parent is responsible. Examples:

"Hazel’s dress-up day is Thursday (your drop-off) – prep outfit tonight."

"Layla’s pizza day canceled tomorrow (your day) – adjust lunch."

5. Daily BriefingDaily summary sent each morning via email:

"Today: Hazel’s library day (return books), Layla’s early dismissal (pick-up at 1:30)."

6. Real-Time Alerts (SMS)For time-sensitive items, users can opt in to receive SMS notifications. Example:

"Reminder: Hazel needs her costume for drama day tomorrow."

7. Mobile Web Interface (V1)A lightweight mobile-friendly view showing:

Timeline of upcoming events filtered to the user's parenting days

Ability to mark events as done or add notes

Roadmap Features

1. Editable Parenting Calendar (Chart Style)Color-coded weekly chart interface to view and edit custody days. Example:

2. Shared Calendar ViewSupport collaborative updates between co-parents with a shared online calendar. Future integrations with Google Calendar or iCal.

3. Two-Way NotificationsIntroduce threads for shared events, where both parents can leave comments or confirm attendance/logistics.

4. Progressive Web App (PWA)Enable push notifications and offline capabilities by making the app installable on mobile devices.
