Goal
Diagnose and resolve the TypeError: Missing parameter name at 1: https://git.new/pathToRegexpError that occurs when starting the Express server. The agent should identify if any registered routes have malformed patterns, empty paths, or accidental variables missing names.

Instructions
Monkey-patch Logging:

After creating the Express app and any router instances, monkey-patch the get, post, and use methods to log every route/path pattern being registered, including the stack trace.

This will help locate malformed or empty paths that may trigger the path-to-regexp error.

Startup Capture:

Run the server as normal.

Capture the full log of registered routes and any stack traces produced during registration.

Source Search:

Grep/search the repository for all occurrences of app.get, app.post, app.use, router.get, router.post, router.use.

Check that every registered route has a non-empty, valid string path (e.g., no accidental app.get("") or router.get() without path).

Specifically look for routes being registered with undefined, empty string, or non-string path arguments.

Route Validation:

For any suspicious registration (blank/undefined/non-string path, route with trailing colon/asterisk but no variable name, etc), provide the file name and line number.

Suggest a correction for the route path as needed.

Patch Plan:

Propose a minimal patch set to fix all invalid route registrations in a single commit.

Agent Output Format
Route Registration Log:
Log of all routes/middlewares registered, with stack traces if available.

Suspicious Routes:
List of any routes with malformed or missing path patterns, with file:line and explanation.

Fix Plan (git-style diff):
Patch blocks showing minimal corrections to route registrations.

Additional Context
The current stack trace references path-to-regexp and a missing parameter name, likely caused by an empty or malformed path string in a route.

The routes module is imported and used with app.use(routes).

The application logs an exported route list just before attaching the router.
