The error message "workspace.edwardstead.replit.devâ€™s server IP address could not be found" indicates a DNS (Domain Name System) resolution issue. This means that when your application (or the browser trying to reach it) attempted to connect to workspace.edwardstead.replit.dev , it couldn't translate that domain name into a numerical IP address.

This isn't directly an OAuth configuration error with Google Cloud, but rather an issue with your application's deployment or network accessibility. Here's a breakdown of what could be happening and how to troubleshoot it:

Replit Application Status:
Is your Replit app running? If the Replit workspace or application isn't actively running, it won't have an IP address for workspace.edwardstead.replit.dev to resolve to. Go to your Replit workspace and ensure your application is started and active.
Is it running on the correct port? Replit often exposes applications on specific ports. Ensure your application is listening on the port that Replit expects (often 80 or 443 internally, but Replit handles the external routing).
DNS Propagation/Resolution:
Temporary Network Glitch: Sometimes, DNS servers can have temporary issues resolving domain names.
Solution: Try again after a few minutes. You can also try flushing your local DNS cache or restarting your network device (router/modem).
Check DNS status: While outside the scope of Google Cloud, tools like nslookup or online DNS checkers can sometimes help confirm if the domain is resolving globally.
Authorized Redirect URIs Mismatch (Indirectly related):
Even though the error is about finding your server's IP, it often appears after the user has authenticated with Google and Google is trying to redirect back to your application.
Problem: If the "Authorized Redirect URI" you configured in the Google Cloud Console for your OAuth client ID is https://workspace.edwardstead.replit.dev/oauth2callback (or similar) and that address isn't reachable or resolvable, Google's redirect will fail, leading to this kind of error in the browser.
Solution:
Verify your Replit URL: Ensure that workspace.edwardstead.replit.dev is the correct and current public URL for your running Replit application. Replit URLs can sometimes change or require specific run configurations.
Match Exactly: Make sure the "Authorized Redirect URI" in your Google Cloud Console's OAuth Client ID configuration exactly matches the URL your Replit application expects to receive the redirect, including the path (e.g., /oauth2callback ).
Firewall or Proxy (Less common for Replit, but possible):
If you are running your browser or app in an environment with a strict firewall or proxy, it might be blocking the DNS lookup or the connection to the Replit domain.
To resolve this:

Confirm your Replit app is running and accessible: The very first step is to ensure that if you just type https://workspace.edwardstead.replit.dev into a browser, you can reach your Replit application. If you can't reach it directly, then Google's OAuth redirect won't be able to either.
Check your Replit URL against Google Cloud: Double-check the "Authorized redirect URIs" in your Google Cloud Console for your OAuth client ID. Ensure it exactly matches the URL that your Replit application is using for the OAuth callback.
This issue is primarily about your Replit environment's accessibility, not a misconfiguration within Google Cloud's OAuth setup itself, beyond ensuring the redirect URI points to a valid and reachable endpoint
